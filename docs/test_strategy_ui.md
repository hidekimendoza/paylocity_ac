3. Features to Be Tested (UI Testing)
The UI testing, utilizing Pytest and Selenium, will cover the following functional and non-functional aspects of the web application's user interface:

3.1. User Interaction and Flows (Functional)

3.2. UI Elements and Data Integrity (Functional)

Form Validations:

Verification of required fields.

Validation of data types (e.g., numbers only, valid email format).

Display of appropriate error messages for invalid input.

Correct handling of boundary conditions in input fields.

Navigation:

All primary and secondary navigation links are clickable and lead to the correct pages.

Back/forward browser button functionality.

Content Display:

Accuracy and consistency of text, images, and other multimedia content.

Verification that data displayed on the UI matches expected values from the backend.

3.3. Non-Functional Testing (UI)

Responsiveness:

Basic checks to ensure the layout, images, and text adapt correctly to different screen sizes and orientations (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile viewpoints). .

Absence of horizontal scrollbars on standard viewports.

Accessibility (Automated Basic Checks):

Integration of automated accessibility scans (e.g., using axe-selenium) to identify common issues such as:

Missing alt attributes for images.

Insufficient color contrast.

Missing or incorrect ARIA labels for interactive elements.

Logical tab order for keyboard navigation.

Basic UI Load Performance:

Measurement of page load times for critical pages (e.g., homepage, product listing, checkout). This will be a light check to flag major regressions, not a dedicated performance test.

4. Features Not to Be Tested (UI Testing Specific)
4.1. Comprehensive Cross-Browser/Cross-Device Compatibility:

While basic responsiveness is checked, exhaustive testing across all browser versions, operating systems, and physical devices is outside the scope. Focus will be on major, modern browser versions (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) on common OS.

4.2. In-depth Usability Testing:

Formal user studies, A/B testing, or extensive qualitative feedback sessions are outside this test plan's scope.

4.3. Full Accessibility Audit:

Automated checks will be performed, but a complete, manual accessibility audit against specific compliance standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA) is not included.

4.4. UI Localization/Internationalization:

Testing of multiple languages or regional formats is not included unless explicitly specified for a particular market.
